# Lake-Erie-Coastal-Strategies-Library

This site is a working site for the process of the final strategies. At its current state, it remains incomplete as the team is still working on the types of possible strategies that are connected to the results of the [Lake Erie Coastal Unit Explorer](https://github.com/junyi2022/Lake-Erie-Coastal-Unit-Explorer).
